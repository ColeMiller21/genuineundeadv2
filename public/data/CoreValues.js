    question: "SAFGUARDING DECENTRALIZATION",
    answer:
      "Decentralization aims to empower the collective and enable the wider audience (community) to partake in governance. We understand the need for it and the importance of autonomy. At the same time we understand that decentralization, from an organizational perspective comes with its own issues. GU aims to safeguard the values of decentralization, in a way that has never been done before. This is done by creating a network of councils run by the community and employing web2 efficiency into a Decentralized mesh. By doing so, we are able to harness the potential of the collective by encouraging and cultivating the contributions from each and every member of the community, curating it and amplifying it with a common goal. Each member’s role is recognized and respected, allowing the power of all to harmonize – to become the work product of the project.",
