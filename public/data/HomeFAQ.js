    question: "What is Genuine Undead?",
    answer: `GU is forging a new path in the NFT space. Too many projects lay out roadmaps with extravagant promises which end up empty. WIth GU, you get spectacular pixel art, and we have a special saying that The Community is the Utility.

      Over 70 community members are working each and every day to move the project forward. These community efforts have already taken the project to significant levels for a free mint, and this growth will continue in the future.`,

    question: "Will there be a roadmap in the future?",
    answer: `There will be no Web3 roadmap. Instead, we will have a well-conceived, intelligent and well-structured business plan. We are committed to building a platform that is driven by the members of our community. We are looking to our members to shape the direction of the project. 

    In the meantime, we will continue to provide a welcoming and inclusive environment where everyone can feel comfortable participating and contributing.`,

  {
    question: "How does the GU organization operate?",
    answer: `Genuine Undead takes the best of what Web2 has to offer and layers on the decentralized approach of Web3. We operate using a system of 9 councils. Each council is responsible for working on a specific agenda and achieving a defined set of goals.

    The councils are made up of community members with expertise in each specific area. The members are elected by their peers to represent their interests and contribute to the growth of the project. The council based governance model allows us to harness the collective knowledge and expertise of the community to drive the success of the project.`,

    question: "Why is there no advertising on this platform?",
    answer:
      "We want to create a space that is free from distractions and focused on meaningful conversation and community building. This means we do not allow advertising on our platform.",

  {
    question: "Why are there no chatters or shillers allowed?",
    answer:
      "We want to foster a community of thoughtful and respectful users who are genuinely interested in engaging with each other. Chatters and shillers often disrupt that atmosphere by spamming messages or promoting their own agendas.",
  },

  {
    question: "Does GU do collaborations?",
    answer: `As a community run project, GU seeks to benefit all of its holders and contributors. While we are not currently doing any official collaborations, we are open to exploring potential opportunities that would benefit the community.

    In the meantime, we will continue to focus on providing value to our community through the high quality pixel art in our collection and the rich lore that surrounds it. `,

  {
    question: "Do you do airdrops?",
    answer: `Airdrops, mutants, and serums are often used as marketing tools to attract new users and drive engagement. While they can be effective in the short term, they tend to dilute the value of projects by flooding the market with new and unproven assets. As such, we have decided not to offer airdrops, mutants, serums and other unsustainable approaches. `,
